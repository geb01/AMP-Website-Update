Three years after their first jam session in Rau's bedroom, with the addition of bassist Randy Begtang, the Manila-based band has steadily built its own image and amassed a following that continues to grow, performing in all sorts of events around Metro Manila. <br /> As a group with musical tastes that constantly grows and evolves, Lagooon's alternative indie-rock sound has been further influenced by jazz, pop, hip-hop, R&B and shoegaze, among others. This has led to their distinct, lively tone that has been accentuated with sentimental lyrics and groovy riffs.<br /> The boys, along with their mates in Kennedy and Lucy Dee, formed RausHaus Records in the summer of 2020. Here, they'll be releasing their first single, 'Oceanside', a song that reminisces what summer could've been like for them and their friends as high school graduates.",
